# Bikesharing 

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to solidify that having a bike-sharing program in 
Des Moines is a good idea so investors will be interested. Through this analysis, we were
able to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for both riders and genders.
This was broken down even further to show riders and genders per hour per day of the week.

## Results

In the Checkout Times for Users graph, we can see that the busiest time to check out a
bike is around midnight and most people who check out a bike only have it for about
40 minutes or less.

In the Checkout Times by Gender graph, I've separated the riders by gender to see who
checks out bikes the most. Although there are several thousand people's gender unidentified,
it is clear that males check out bikes at least twice as much as females do.

In the Trips by Weekday for each hour graph, it's obvious that bikes are checked out all
times of the days, but the most concentrated times are in the morning from 6 AM to 10 AM,
and in the evening at 5 PM to 8 PM.

In the Trips by Gender graph, it's easier to see which gender checked out bikes by time
because they each have their own graph. While all genders seem to have the same peak times
for checking bikes out, it's clear that males check out a significant amount more bikes
than any other gender.

On my last graph, User Trips by Gender by Weekday, this time I have broken it down by day
instead of hour. This graph shows the difference in random on occasion riders, represented 
by 'customer' and riders who rider very often, represented by 'subscriber'. Male bikers
have the highest subscriber count every day of the week by far. 

## Summary

In summary, this study gave us a lot of information. We now know that thousands of male
bike riders prefer to check out a bike from the city. It appears that more males check out
bikes during the peak traffic hours of every weekday. All genders sleep in a bit on the
weekend, but definitely still check out bikes on the weekend, but more so in the middle
of the day, between 10 AM and 7 PM. I think for further analysis, we could check time 
of year of riders for all genders.
